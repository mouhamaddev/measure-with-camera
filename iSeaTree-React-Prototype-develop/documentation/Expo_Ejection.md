# Expo Ejection

In September 2021, the project migrated from using Expo to being a pure React Native project. This was so we could have better low-level access to cameras and other native tools.

# iSeaTree bare react native 

- iSeaTree bare react native is the expo ejected project

# Run Project

- npm install or yarn install
- ios: 
    npx react-native run-ios
- android:
    npx react-native run-android

## dependency Changes:

- replace `firebase` dependency with `@react-native-firebase`
- replace `expo-camera` dependency with `react-native-camera`

### why change `firebase` dependency with `@react-native-firebase`?

- well as per the new flow `firebase` is not recognised by the react-native
- and it's make project future proof

### why change `expo-camera` dependency with `react-native-camera`?

- to fix rotation image issue
